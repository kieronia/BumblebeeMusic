Bumblebee mp3 Is Here!!
Hope you enjoy, just follow the required pip installs - [pip install pygame] etc - and have fun aha. 
This simply plays audio - it doesn't download it. Put this in the path with your audio files and have fun!
Unless you change the code - bring opening.mp3 with it.
Hope you enjoy - Ik there are better audio players but I thought this would be a fun project and I like the layout.
Might make it so you can select the file location with tkinter soon, and might make it allow downloads etc but yeahhhhh.
